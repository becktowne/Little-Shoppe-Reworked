This was initally assigned as a group project for an Intro to Programming course at Marist College.
There were four group members that collaborated on the original project: Devin Melillo, Soph Masone, Grace Markus, and myself, Beck Towne.
I am the only member involved in this reworked version of the project.
The goal of the original project was to create a warehouse management system and corrisponding GUI in Python. 
My team put a creative spin on the project, instead creating a fantasy item shop.
We had high expectations for the project, which led to us independently learning how to execute many of the features we wanted to include. 
As a group, we were inexperienced with large programming projects. This, plus a time crunch, led the code to be disorganized.
Additionally, many of the features we intended to include never made it into the final version of the program. 
The reworked version of this project aims to fix these issues, as I thought it would be a shame never to see this project reach its full potential.
